      <h1>Testimonials:</h1>
      <p>
        I was recently at the Dalzell's Auto Repair for a vehicle service and
        began to visit with an elderly customer who was also there. Although I
        had been a customer for several years, I was surprised to learn that
        this gentleman had been a customer for several decades! When I asked him
        why kept coming back to Dalzells, he stated, "...they are the best, they
        fix the problem and I always know what the bill is when I pick up my
        car." <br />On a side note, he jokingly ribbed one of the employees of
        Dalzell's (Gord) who was retired from Canadian Forces/Army, stating that
        he felt the Canadian Navy was tougher than the Canadian Army. I called a
        tie. </p> <p>Kevin F.</p>
