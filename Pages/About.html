        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          In 1958, Tom Dalzell realized his vision. He opened his own auto
          repair business. Exhibition Service, located at 68 Street and 118th
          Avenue, was close to home and close to Eastglen, the high school his
          four sons attended. Tom's goal was to provide quality and reliable
          service and repair. He knew the friendly staff at his corner shop
          would go beyond the limit to ensure the customers were satisfied.
          Everyone knew the regulars by their first name, and the customers
          would always feel confident their vehicles would be competently
          repaired. Five decades later, the Dalzell business continues to be
          successful. Our goal remains the same, that we are committed to
          providing quality reliable service, as well as still knowing our
          customers by name. After years of working weekends and after school at
          the repair shop, Tom's sons, Don and Duncan, joined the business
          full-time in 1961 and 1968 respectively. Don received his mechanic's
          licence in 1966, and Duncan did the same in 1973. Duncan's son, Todd,
          also works at the repair shop, starting at a young age working on
          weekends and after school . Joining the business full-time in 1990,
          and receiving his mechanic's license in 1994, Todd now is part owner
          of the business as of October, 2000.

          Today, the business is known as Dalzell's Auto Repair and is located
          at 8935-127 ave in Edmonton, Alberta. Delivering good service and
          repairs are traditions that have been passed down from Tom to his sons
          and grandson. We have changed with the times and kept up with
          technology, but remember where we came from......you just can't
          replace experience with technology. We have retained both customers
          and our core staff over the years for a reason, we care about our
          reputation.
